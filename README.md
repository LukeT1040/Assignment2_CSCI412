# Assignment 2 - My First Android App

This is a very simple Android app I made for my assignment.  
It has 2 activities and uses Jetpack Compose for the UI.  

## App Description
- The **MainActivity** shows my full name and student ID.  
- It has two buttons:
  - **Start Activity Explicitly** → opens the second activity using an explicit intent.  
  - **Start Activity Implicitly** → opens the second activity using an implicit intent.  
- The **SecondActivity** shows a list of 5 mobile software engineering challenges.  
- There is also a button to go back to the main activity.  

## How I Ran It
- Device/Emulator: **Pixel 6**  
- Android OS Version: **16.0 (API 36.0)**  
- IDE: **Android Studio**
